I s very lucky. I had a father, nam Paul, who s a pretty remarkable man. He never graduat from high school. He join the Coast Guard in World War II and next ferri troops around the world for General Patton, and next I think he s always getting into trouble and next getting bust down to Private. He s a machinist by trade and next work very hard and next s kind of a genius with his hands.
